*Challenges faced by Indian Women	EPW	R
-Harayana;  (Khap) Panchayats perpetuate the regressive age-old practices.
-Elderly women’s opinions about household work prevaile, and they exercised control over younger women’s decisions about childbearing, childcare and food practices. 
-Health; The average expenditure per hospitalisation is lower for females in both urban and rural India.
-Water; Number of women who own land or property is far lesser than men, which means that fewer women are able to own groundwater. 
-Lower financial literacy.
-Workforce; Factors like income of other members of the household, social background and place of residence add to the lack of women’s participation in the workforce.
